# 🎯 Project Overview

Urban runners and cyclists often struggle to find routes that are not only efficient but also safe and reliable. **SafeStride** addresses this gap by offering a centralized, community-verified platform for route discovery and safety feedback.

**Sprint Duration:** Feb 10 – Mar 9, 2026 (4 weeks)
**Current Status:** MVP Development
**Team Members:** Shankar, Lithish, Dhanya

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Urban athletes face several challenges:

Lack of reliable safety information for running and cycling routes
No centralized platform for community-verified route data
Uncertainty around lighting, traffic levels, and surface quality
Time wasted exploring unfamiliar or unsafe areas

# Introduction to Flutter and Dart

## Project Structure

lib/
├── main.dart
├── screens/
├── widgets/
├── models/
├── services/

### Directory Purpose

**main.dart**  
  Entry point of the application. Initializes the app and loads the first screen.

**screens/**  
  Contains full UI screens such as WelcomeScreen, LoginScreen, etc.

**widgets/**  
  Reusable UI components shared across screens (buttons, cards, custom inputs).

**models/**  
  Data models used for handling structured data.

**services/**  
  Business logic, API calls, and Firebase integration (future use).

### Modular Design Benefits
This structure separates concerns, improves readability, and allows the app to scale without becoming cluttered.

### Naming Conventions
Files: snake_case.dart
Classes & Widgets: PascalCase
Variables & functions: camelCase

## Widget Tree Concept

In Flutter, everything is a widget — text, buttons, containers, and even layouts.

Widgets are arranged in a tree structure, known as the widget tree, where each node represents a part of the UI.

The root of the tree is usually the MaterialApp or CupertinoApp widget, followed by nested child widgets.

### Example Widget Tree Structure

MaterialApp
 ┣ initialRoute: '/'
 ┣ routes: {...}
 ┗ home: WelcomeScreen
      ┣ Scaffold
      ┃  ┣ AppBar
      ┃  ┃  ┗ Text('SafeStride')
      ┃  ┗ Body
      ┃     ┗ Center
      ┃        ┗ Column
      ┃           ┣ Text('Welcome to SafeStride!')
      ┃           ┣ Icon(Icons.directions_walk)
      ┃           ┣ ElevatedButton('Toggle State')
      ┃           ┗ Column (Demos)
      ┃              ┣ Text('Flutter Learning Demos:')
      ┃              ┣ ElevatedButton('Widget Tree Demo')
      ┃              ┣ ElevatedButton('Profile Card Demo')
      ┃              ┗ ElevatedButton('Counter App Demo')

### Widget Tree for Counter App Demo

Scaffold
 ┣ AppBar
 ┃  ┗ Text('Counter App Demo')
 ┗ Body
    ┗ Container (with gradient)
       ┗ Center
          ┗ Column
             ┣ Text('Counter App Demo')
             ┣ Container (display box)
             ┃  ┗ Text(displaying count)
             ┣ Row (controls)
             ┃  ┣ FloatingActionButton(decrement)
             ┃  ┣ FloatingActionButton(reset)
             ┃  ┗ FloatingActionButton(increment)
             ┗ Container (instructions)
                ┗ Text(explanation of reactive UI)

## Reactive UI Model

Flutter's UI is reactive, meaning that when data (state) changes, the framework automatically rebuilds the affected widgets.

The UI is not manually redrawn; instead, Flutter efficiently re-renders only what needs updating.

### Example using setState():

dart
class CounterApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterAppState createState() => _CounterAppState();
}

class _CounterAppState extends State<CounterApp> {
  int count = 0;

  void increment() {
    setState(() {
      count++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reactive UI Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Count: $count'),
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: increment, child: Text('Increment')),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

Every time the button is pressed, the state changes (count++), and Flutter rebuilds the relevant parts of the widget tree.

## Interactive Elements Demonstrating State Updates

The SafeStride app includes several examples that demonstrate state updates:

1. **Welcome Screen**: Toggles between welcome message and updated message when button is pressed
2. **Counter App Demo**: Updates count value when increment/decrement buttons are pressed
3. **Profile Card Demo**: Toggles favorite status and online/offline status
4. **Widget Tree Demo**: Shows various reactive UI elements that update when interacted with

These examples showcase how Flutter's reactive model rebuilds the widget tree when state changes occur.



# Stateless vs Stateful Widget Demo

## Overview
This Flutter demo showcases the fundamental difference between **StatelessWidget** and **StatefulWidget** by clearly separating static UI from interactive, state-driven UI. The app displays a static header and an interactive counter to demonstrate how Flutter rebuilds widgets based on state changes.

---

## StatelessWidget
A StatelessWidget does not store or manage any mutable state. Its UI depends only on the data provided to it and remains unchanged unless its parent rebuilds it.

**Use cases:** headers, labels, icons, static text.

dart
class DemoHeader extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;

  const DemoHeader({super.key, required this.title});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(title);
  }
}
```
Demo Behavior

The header remains unchanged (StatelessWidget).

Pressing the button increments the counter (StatefulWidget).

Only the stateful portion of the UI rebuilds on interaction.

Reflection

Stateful widgets enable dynamic and interactive Flutter apps by allowing controlled UI updates through state changes. Separating static and reactive UI improves clarity, performance, and maintainability by enforcing clear responsibility boundaries.

# Flutter Navigation Demo


## Hot Reload, Debug Console, and DevTools Demonstration

## Features
- Home screen with a button to navigate forward
- Details screen with a button to go back
- Navigation handled using Flutter’s `Navigator` stack
- Optional data passing between screens

## Route Setup (main.dart)
```dart
MaterialApp(
  initialRoute: '/',
  routes: {
    '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
    '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(),
  },
);

I used Flutter DevTools to inspect the widget tree and analyze performance. These tools improve productivity, debugging, and app performance.


# Flutter Multi-Screen Navigation

This project demonstrates basic multi-screen navigation in Flutter using the Navigator class and named routes. The app contains two screens: HomeScreen and SecondScreen. Navigation is handled using Navigator.pushNamed() to move forward and Navigator.pop() to return.

Routes are defined inside MaterialApp using the routes map and initialRoute is set to "/". This keeps navigation organized and easy to scale.

Example routes setup in main.dart:

```dart
routes: {
  '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
  '/second': (context) => SecondScreen(),
}
```

Navigator manages a stack of screens, where each new screen is pushed on top and removed when popped. Named routes improve readability, maintainability, and scalability in larger apps.



# Responsive Layout Design

## Overview

This project demonstrates a responsive layout using Flutter’s core layout widgets:

- Container
- Row
- Column
- Expanded
- MediaQuery

The layout adapts to different screen sizes.

Phone → Vertical layout  
Tablet → Horizontal layout  

---

## Code Example

```dart
Row(
 children: [
  Expanded(child: ProfileCard()),
  Expanded(child: Dashboard()),
 ]
)
